              What kind of interface should Roomkast have?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Roomkast describes itself as a "profile-matching tool for people
              who see the value in co-sharing a place to live.”
            </p>
            <p>
              We thought the people most likely to be looking for a roommate
              would be younger people individuals who had just moved to a
              metropolitan area and would like to split rent for an apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the widespread use of dating apps among young people, we
              thought Roomkast users would prefer to use an interface with
              similar navigation and design elements.

            <h2 className="big-section-title">Exploring Design Alternatives</h2>
            <p>
              Each member of our team created a set of sketches detailing what
              we imagined the app to look like in order to generate a diversity
              of approaches to solving Roomkast’s goals.

            <p>
              After reviewing our sketches, we discussed which designs most
              effectively solved Roomkast’s goals as a startup.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We decided a profile-focused rather than apartment-focused app
                better solved the description of Roomkast as a “profile-matching
                tool".
              </li>
              <li>
                We liked the survey idea to determine compatibility, but we felt
                that giving a predefined list of matches was too restrictive. We
                wanted users to be able to endlessly scroll through and discover
                profiles if they liked.
              </li>
              <li>
                We agreed that being able to create group profiles and message
                via the app were important features.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From our discussion, we combined our sketches to produce a final
              set of wireframes we would use to create our high-fidelity
              prototype.

            <p>
              Based on our combined wireframes, we made an initial prototype of
              the Roomkast app. We didn’t include all possible interactions or
              screens, but implemented enough to explore and test the key
              functionalities of the app.

              To improve our prototype, we participated in a design critique
              with a UX researcher. Below, you can see how we incorporated
              feedback from the critique to revise our high-fidelity prototype.

            <h2 className="big-section-title">User testing Roomkast</h2>
            <p>
              We conducted usability testing via the platform{" "}
              <a href="usertesting.com">UserTesting.com</a>. We wanted to choose
              task that would explore Roomkast’s primary functionality: to find
              someone compatible to live with. Eventually, we settled on a task
              that most real users of the app would accomplish: creating an
              account and messaging a potential roommate.
            </p>

            <p>
              We then split this main task into five subtasks for our tests to
              complete:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Select a login method and create an individual profile.</li>
              <li>
                Interact with the discovery page to look at people's profiles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reach out to Amelia (a potential housemate) by sending her a
                message.
              </li>
              <li>Pin Amelia's conversation in the messages tab.</li>
              <li>Sort the conversations by compatibility</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
              <h3>Analyzing Our Results</h3>
              <p>
                Our testing surfaced some remaining usability issues in our
                interface that were not noticed during the group critique. These
                included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The pinning animation could be unresponsive and confusing
                </li>
                <li>
                  On some screens, the navbar was not properly fixed, requiring
                  users needed to scroll to the bottom of the page to navigate
                  between screens.{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                At the same time, the user testing helped validate our
                intuitions about the simplicitly and learnability our designs
                and user experience:{" "}
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users thought the fonts and colors contributed to a clean
                  design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users understood the compability system intuitively without
                  the need for further explanation
                </li>
                <li>
                  All three users believed that they were able to complete the
                  task successfully, rating the easiness of the task as a 4/5.

            <p>
              I had a ton of fun working with a team brainstorming and refining
              designs to create a solution for Roomkast. Here were my main
              takeaways:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Don't reinvent the wheel.</b> It might be fun to try to
                brainstorm designs that might bring about the next revolution in
                user interfaces, but especially as someone at the beginning of
                their UI/UX journey, leveraging tried-and-true conventions (such
                as the the bottom navbar) allows me to create the best
                experience for my users.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Get as many fresh eyes on your designs as you can. </b>After
                too long staring at our prototypes, everything starts to bleed
                together. Even a remote usability test from one user was
                invaluable for detecting issues with our interface that had
                become invisible to us.
